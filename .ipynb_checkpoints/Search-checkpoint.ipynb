While using certain graph algorithms, you must ensure that each vertex of the graph is visited exactly once. The order in which the vertices are visited are important and may depend upon the algorithm or question that you are solving.\n",

    "\n",
    "BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.\n",

    "A graph can contain cycles, which may bring you to the same node again while traversing the graph. To avoid processing of same node again, use a boolean array which marks the node after it is processed. While visiting the nodes in the layer of a graph, store them in a manner such that you can traverse the corresponding child nodes in a similar order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the earlier diagram, start traversing from 0 and visit its child nodes 1, 2, and 3. Store them in the order in which they are visited. This will allow you to visit the child nodes of 1 first (i.e. 4 and 5), then of 2 (i.e. 6 and 7), and then of 3 (i.e. 7) etc.\n",

    "To make this process easy, use a **queue** to store the node and mark it as 'visited' until all its neighbours (vertices that are directly connected to it) are marked.

    "Let us say that we have a machine, and to determine its state at time t, we have certain quantities called state variables. There will be certain times when we have to make a decision which affects the state of the system, which may or may not be known to us in advance. These decisions or changes are equivalent to transformations of state variables. The results of the previous decisions help us in choosing the future ones.\n",

    "* Dynamic Programming and Recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is basically, recursion plus using common sense. What it means is that recursion allows you to express the value of a function in terms of other values of that function. Where the common sense tells you that if you implement your function in a way that the recursive calls are done in advance, and stored for easy access, it will make your program faster. This is what we call Memorization - it is memorizing the results of some specific states, which can then be later accessed to solve other sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind dynamic programming is that we trade space for time, i.e. to say that instead of calculating all the states taking a lot of time but no space, we take up space to store the results of all the sub-problems to save time later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand this by taking an example of Fibonacci numbers.\n",

    "    Fibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 0\n",
    "    Fibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 1\n",
    "    Fibonacci (n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)\n",

    "            return 1;\n",
    "        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "Using Dynamic Programming approach with memorization:\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recursive code, a lot of values are being recalculated multiple times. We could do good with calculating each unique quantity only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Majority of the Dynamic Programming problems can be categorized into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optimization problems.\n",
    "2. Combinatorial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problems expect you to select a feasible solution, so that the value of the required function is minimized or maximized. Combinatorial problems expect you to figure out the number of ways to do something, or the probability of some event happening.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * Show that the problem can be broken down into optimal sub-problems.\n",
    "    * Recursively define the value of the solution by expressing it in terms of optimal solutions for smaller sub-problems.\n",
    "    *Compute the value of the optimal solution in bottom-up fashion.\n",
    "    * Construct an optimal solution from the computed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom up vs. Top Down:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom Up - I\\'m going to learn programming. Then, I will start practicing. Then, I will start taking part in contests. Then, I\\'ll practice even more and try to improve. After working hard like crazy, I\\'ll be an amazing coder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Not a great example, but hope it get's the point across. In Top Down, you start building the big solution right away by explaining how you build it from smaller solutions. In Bottom Up, you start with the small solutions and then build up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorization is very easy to code and might be your first line of approach for a while. Though, with dynamic programming, you don\\'t risk blowing stack space, you end up with lots of liberty of when you can throw calculations away. The downside is that you have to come up with an ordering of a solution which works.\n",
    "\n",
